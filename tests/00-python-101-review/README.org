* 00) Python 101 Review

  To run tests:
  : $ python test.py

  Initially they should fail.
  To get started fixing them, make a copy of `review.py` named `review_local.py`.
  In the shell:
  : $ cp review.py review_local.py

  After that, make changes to the functions in `review_local.py` and test with `test.py` until all tests pass.
